Invasion, or otherwise known as _Project Invasion_, is a game that intends to reproduce and complete Valve's vision of Team Fortress 2 as it was to be in 2003, before it restarted development to become the game we know today.

While we aim for authenticity, we do have to take some creative liberties given the nature of Team Fortress 2's state at the time, being very much a mess of ideas carried through years of development.
